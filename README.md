# USGS Earthquake Visualization Project

## Overview

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Visualization Project is a web-based data visualization tool that allows users to explore earthquake data collected by the USGS. The project aims to provide a meaningful and interactive way of visualizing earthquake data to educate the public and inform government organizations about the Earth's seismic activity.

### Create the Earthquake Visualization

In this part, we visualize earthquake data from the USGS. The key features include:

- Retrieving earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed.
- Using Leaflet, creating an interactive map that plots earthquake locations based on longitude and latitude.
- Representing earthquake magnitude with marker size and earthquake depth with marker color.
- Providing pop-up information for each earthquake when a marker is clicked.
- Creating a legend to explain the map's data representation.

## Data Sources

The earthquake data is sourced from the USGS GeoJSON Feed, which provides updated earthquake data every 5 minutes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, JavaScript, CSS
- Leaflet.js (for mapping)
- USGS GeoJSON Feed (for earthquake data)

## Project Status

This project is intended for educational purposes and serves as a starting point for visualizing earthquake data. It can be extended and customized for more in-depth seismic analysis.
